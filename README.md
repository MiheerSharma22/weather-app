# Overview
This is a JS project to work and get comfortable with the APIs. <br>
This is a weather project where-in initially the user is asked to grant his location permission. Once the user does that, his latitude and longitude are stored using the <b><i>navigator.geolocation</b></i>, and these are used to fetch his location's weather using the openweathermap API.
Also the user can choose to search for a city by its name to know its weather, the user entered city name is used to fetch the weather of that city by passing it in the API.

# My Learnings
<ul>
<li> One of my major learning in this project is how to use <b><i>navigator.geolocation</b></i> and store information using destructuring.</li>
<li> Furthermore, I learned how to call and fetch data using API(s) and async-await and how to convert that data in json format using the <b><i>.json()</b></i>.</li>
<li> Moreover, I learned how to store and retrieve the data from the <b><i>Session storage</b></i>.
